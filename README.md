## Overview

### Description

This project is a Connect Four game that allows human player vs. human player gameplay (alternating turns on the same screen). The goal of this project was to practice css by getting as close as possible to the provided designs.

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the rules of the game
- [x] Engage in a Connect Four match against another human player (with alternating turns on the same screen)
- [x] See that the design/layout adjusts responsively based on the screen size of their device
- [x] See that the discs animate into their position when a move is made
